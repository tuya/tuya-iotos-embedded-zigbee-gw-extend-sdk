# Tuya Embedded Zigbee Gateway Extension SDK

[English](README.md) | [中文版](README_cn.md)

## Overview
Tuya gateway extension SDK is developed and provided by Tuya Gateway Department. The SDK is a solution code to connect with Tuya Cloud Development Platform. The SDK integrates the Gateway & Zigbee module, and realizes the communication among the gateway, Tuya Cloud Development Platform, and Tuya app. You can focus on business development without concern for the communication layer. This lowers the threshold for gateway development.

The SDK is the basement of multiple gateway products, and plays a vital role to enhance product differentiation. The supported products include but are not limited to:

- Zigbee gateway
    Powered by the SDK, a third-party system can control and manage Zigbee devices.

- Zigbee extension gateway
    Powered by the SDK, a third-party system can link with non-Tuya ecology Zigbee devices. Developers can link non-Tuya ecology Zigbee sub-devices with the Tuya Cloud Development Platform.

- Multi-protocol gateway
    Powered by the SDK, a third-party system can link with multi-protocol devices, and link non-Zigbee protocol devices with Tuya Cloud Development Platform. For example, multi-protocol devices support the following combinations of protocols: Zigbee + 443, Zigbee + 443 + Z-Wave.

- Multi-function gateway
    Powered by the SDK, a third-party system can act as a multi-function gateway. For example, you can connect to night lights, sound-light alarms, and different sensors to implement multiple smart scenarios.
